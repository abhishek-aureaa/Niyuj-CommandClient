A)clone repository : https://github.com/abhishek-aureaa/Niyuj-CommandClient
Command : 
1)git clone https://github.com/abhishek-aureaa/Niyuj-CommandClient

B)Build the source files 
Commands :

2)gcc server.c -o server
3)gcc client.c -o client

C) Run Steps
Commands
1) ./server >& ./server.log
2) ./client <Server-IPAddress> 5432
e.g.,
./client 127.0.0.1 5432 


D) Testing Steps
After running a the client as above, command prompt would appear , enter the commands there :
As only "ls" & "pwd" have to be supported, appropriate error message would returned by the server, in case any command other than would be sent. e.g. df, ps etc
Commands :
-----------------------
a) ls 
b) pwd
c) df 
d) cd <DirectoryName>, 
These will work : 
Full Directory Name : e.g.,  cd /home/Niyuj-Abhishek
Relative Directory Name : e.g.,  cd home/Niyuj-Abhishek OR cd home OR cd Niyuj-Abhishek
Dot-Dot(..) Directoy Name : e.g., cd .. 
More than one space after cd works : e.g.,  cd /home/Niyuj-Abhishek
