Prerequisites : 
1. The assignment was tested on Ubuntu 18. It should work on other Linux Operating systems as well
2. If Ubuntu 18 machine is not available than Optionally - Please Download ubuntu 18 iso & create Oracle VirtualBox VM using it
Link : https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.4/ubuntu-18.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso
2. Install gcc - GNU C/C++ compiler

Build/Run/Tests steps 
A) Please download the  Niyuj-CommandClient.zip & Unzip it to folder

B)Build the source files 
Commands : 
1)cd Niyuj-CommandClient
2)gcc server.c -o server
3)gcc client.c -o client

C) Run Steps
Commands
1) ./server >& ./server.log
2) ./client <Server-IPAddress> 5432
e.g.,
./client 127.0.0.1 5432 


D) Testing Steps
After running the client as above, command prompt would appear , enter the commands there :
As only "ls" & "pwd" have to be supported, appropriate error message would be returned by the server, in case any command other than these would be sent. e.g. df, ps etc
Commands :
-----------------------
a) ls 
b) pwd
c) df 
d) cd <DirectoryName>, 
These will work : 
Full Directory Name : e.g.,  cd /home/Niyuj-Abhishek
Relative Directory Name : e.g.,  cd home/Niyuj-Abhishek OR cd home OR cd Niyuj-Abhishek
Dot-Dot(..) Directoy Name : e.g., cd .. 
More than one space after cd works : e.g.,  cd /home/Niyuj-Abhishek
-----------------------



Other Points :
----------------------------------------
1. Assumption, Filename with ls command is not sent with full pathname e.g. a/b/c/d.c & only the filename("d.c) is sent
2. If the command(one after other) output are getting mixed up, please try with sending commands with a time difference(1 sec or fraction of it)
3. timestamp is not working at the moment for directory, i am trying to correct it
4. tried stat() based mechanism for creation date : it did not give correct results, in intial attempts
----------------------
   /*dt will give the file creation date : */
       struct stat st;
       char* dt = NULL;
       struct  tm *gmtm;
       if(stat(filename, &st) != 0 )
       {
          gmtm = gmtime(&(st.st_ctime));
          printf("i am here\n");
          dt = asctime(gmtm); 
       }
----------------------
If required, I can work & complete any of the above steps, in "Other Points" section
